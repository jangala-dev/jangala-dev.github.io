<h1 class="category-title">Contributing to Jangala’s Knowledge Base</h1>
<p>
    This is a short guide on how to contribute to Jangala’s knowledge base. Our knowledge base can be found at the link below:
    https://github.com/jangala-dev.github.io/docs/tree/main
</p>

<h2>Adding a Document</h2>

<p>Step 1 - Go to the folder where you would like to add a new document:</p>
<img align="center" src="{{ '/assets/img/contributing3.png' | relative_url }}" width="60%" />

<p>Step 2 - Click “Add file” and then click “Create new file”:</p>
<img align="center" src="{{ '/assets/img/contributing7.png' | relative_url }}" width="30%" />

<p>Step 3 - Create a document with a document name and body. In the example below the document name is test.md. The document name should always end in .md because this signifies we want a document where we can write markdown. The document name should also not contain spaces:</p>
<img align="center" src="{{ '/assets/img/contributing4.png' | relative_url }}" width="60%" />

<p>Step 4 - Click “Commit changes…” and then follow the “Creating Pull Requests” section in the knowledge base guide</p>


<h2>Updating a Document</h2>
<p>Step 1 - Go to the folder where you would like to add a update document:</p>
<img align="center" src="{{ '/assets/img/contributing3.png' | relative_url }}" width="60%" />

<p>Step 2 - Click on document, then click on the pencil icon which will take you to “Edit in place”:</p>
<img align="center" src="{{ '/assets/img/contributing1.png' | relative_url }}" width="30%" />

<p>Step 3 - Edit the document as you see fit:</p>
<img align="center" src="{{ '/assets/img/contributing6.png' | relative_url }}" width="60%" />

<p>Step 4 - Click “Commit changes…” and then follow the “Creating Pull Requests” section in the knowledge base guide</p>

<h2>Creating Pull Requests</h2>

<p>Step 1 - Complete the popup form giving a sensible commit message and description. We then want to click create a new branch for this commit and give the branch name a sensible name like below:</p>
<img align="center" src="{{ '/assets/img/contributing5.png' | relative_url }}" width="30%" />

<p>Step 2 - To create a pull request add a title which briefly describes what the request is, a description which can go into more detail about the request, and add a reviewer this person will review the changes you have made:</p>
<img align="center" src="{{ '/assets/img/contributing2.png' | relative_url }}" width="60%" />

<p>For more information use github’s official documentation for creating pull requests: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request</p>

<h2>Reviewing Pull Requests</h2>
<p>Follow github’s official documentation for reviewing pull requests: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request</p>

<h2>Markdown (GFM)</h2>
<p>Markdown is a simple text formatting language that allows you to write content with plain text and convert it into richly formatted documents. GitHub uses a version of Markdown called "GitHub Flavoured Markdown" (GFM), which is an extension of the original Markdown syntax. Follow github’s official documentation for GFM: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax</p>
