## Our work so far
Jangala has deployed Big Box across 4 continents. In northern Kenya to help refugees gain a secondary education, in Mexico to assist those displaced by violence in Central America, in Indonesia in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, and in the UK to provide emergency internet when other networks fail.
