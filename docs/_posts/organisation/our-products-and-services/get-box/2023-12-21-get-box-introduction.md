## The Need for Get Box

Digital poverty and the divide associated with it are pervasive challenges, transcending geographic boundaries and economic status. In the UK alone, only a minute fraction of state school teachers believe that all their students have access to home internet. This scarcity of resources leaves young people confined within the limits of their family's data plans, with 35% facing restrictions on their online activities.

The problem does not stop at the young; a significant portion of the elderly population is also digitally excluded. As many as 37% of people over 75 years old, which translates to a staggering 2 million individuals, lack digital integration.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has served to further emphasize this divide. Social distancing and lockdowns forced society to become more reliant on digital technologies for connection, services, and remote work or education opportunities. The lack of access has precipitated social isolation, difficulty in obtaining healthcare or education, and constrained job opportunities for many.
