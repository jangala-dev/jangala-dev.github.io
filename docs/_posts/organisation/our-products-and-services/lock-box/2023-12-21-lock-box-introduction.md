## The Need for Lock Box

The advent of digital content and tools has significantly transformed key sectors like education and healthcare. With sufficient bandwidth, billions of individuals today experience rich, interactive, and responsive services. However, these advancements are not ubiquitous. In many areas, internet access is either non-existent, painfully slow, or prohibitively expensive, stunting growth and the potential for positive impacts.

Staggering figures mark the digital divide: over 2.8 million schools lack internet connections, and in excess of 100 million displaced individuals including refugees and internally displaced persons survive with unreliable internet access. Our partners, ranging from War Child to Unicef, have encountered significant challenges in deploying their applications in the field due to these connectivity issues.

## What Lock Box Does (Features)

Lock Box is Jangala's innovative answer to the complex challenges posed by the absence or inadequacy of internet access. It's crafted to transform the delivery of relevant and updatable digital content to diverse groups, particularly where repeated access to such information is critical â€” including scenarios involving students, healthcare providers, government operatives, agricultural workers, and those focused on biodiversity.

### Customer-Facing Features

The design and functionality of Lock Box prioritize enabling comprehensive Internet experiences, regardless of location. Here's how it achieves this ambitious goal:

- **HTTPS Caching:** By accelerating web browsing and caching content, Lock Box ensures smoother online interactions.
- **Deployment Platform:** Serves as a robust platform for deploying a diverse range of tools and content, from offline resources like Wikipedia to more complex web-based applications tailor-fit for local use.
- **Localizing the Internet:** Lock Box is set to narrow the gap in digital content quality, improving the delivery of socially vital services significantly.

## Future of Lock Box

Lock Box is not just any connectivity solution. Its development is anchored on several guiding principles that future-proof its application and maximize its social impact:

- **Open Source:** To foster a community-driven approach to continual improvement and innovation.
- **Low Power:** Ensuring sustainability and accessibility in areas with limited power infrastructure.
- **Stackable:** Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for easy capacity expansion as needs grow.

By focusing on these key attributes, Lock Box is poised to be a game-changing tool in the fight against the digital divide, aligning with the mission to provide accessible, quality internet connections to the places and people that need them most.
